<p>Android app (beta) making it possible to entirely freeze all background activities of any app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get back control over what runs on your phone</li>
<li>Enhance battery life and reduce mobile data usage by freezing rarely used apps</li>
<li>Especially useful while you are on a tour, where you need only some apps but a long battery life</li>
</ul>
<p>Greenify can also do this, but it is not Open Source.</p>
<p>SuperFreezZ is not yet another task manager promising to delete 10 GB of data per month or making your device 2x as fast. This is impossible.</p>
<p>Instead, SuperFreezZ is honest about its disadvantages: Freezing daily used apps probably drains your battery a little faster. Also, these apps will take longer to start when you use them the next time: SuperFreezZ will super freeze your apps, it takes about 1-3 seconds to un-freeze them. Greenify has the same disadvantages, except that the author of Greenify does not warn you about it. So: Just do not overdo it, and SuperFreezZ will be super useful.</p>
<p>Examples for apps that deserve to be frozen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Untrusted apps (that you do not want to run in the background)</li>
<li>Apps you rarely use</li>
<li>Annoying apps</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qa">Q/A</h2>
<p>Q/A:</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between hibernating and freezing? A: There is none at all. If you hibernate an app with Greenify it will even be shown as frozen in SuperFreezZ and the other way round.</p>
<p>Q: But the correct spelling would be “SuperFreeze”! A: I know.</p>
<p>Q: Do you have any intentions to sell freezers? A: No.</p>
